# Space notes

####It's not where you take things from — it's where you take them to.

####Life can be much broader

####I’ve always liked you a lot. That’s too bad.

####May your reign Continue for a thousand, eight thousand generations, Until the pebbles grow into boulders Lush with moss.

####How can a man die better than facing fearful odds. For the ashes of his father and the temples of his Gods.
