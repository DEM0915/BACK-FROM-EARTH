# Space notes

####It's not where you take things from — it's where you take them to.

####Life can be much broader.

####As soon as you stop wanting something, you get it.

####I’ve always liked you a lot. That’s too bad.

####May your reign Continue for a thousand, eight thousand generations, Until the pebbles grow into boulders Lush with moss.

####How can a man die better than facing fearful odds, For the ashes of his fathers and the temples of his Gods.

####Just because we were competing with somebody doesn't mean we have to be rude.


####As ever, they look to seduce and captivate and intoxicate us, to draw us in, draw us close, never let us go.

####Design: the invention of desire.

####Our want for material possessions, our possession and passing on of heirlooms, our want to leave a legacy.

####Desire means imbalance.

####You and I have memories longer than the road that stretches out ahead.

####Isn't it funny, a ship that leaks from the top.
