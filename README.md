# Space notes

####It's not where you take things from — it's where you take them to.

####Life can be much broader.

####I’ve always liked you a lot. That’s too bad.

####May your reign Continue for a thousand, eight thousand generations, Until the pebbles grow into boulders Lush with moss.

####How can a man die better than facing fearful odds, For the ashes of his fathers and the temples of his Gods.

####Just because we were competing with somebody doesn't mean: we have to be rude.

####As soon as you stop wanting something, you get it.
